shadowsocks-erlang
===========
Totally asynchronous implementation of Shadowsocks in Erlang.

Usage
-----------
* Compile


    `./rebar clean & ./rebar compile`

  Of course, Elang OTP is needed, I am using R15B01, other versions should works fine(maybe should 
  use your own rebar)
* Client side

        erl -config ./local.config -pa ./ebin/ -boot start_sasl -s shadowsocks_app start -noshell
* Server side
   
        erl -config ./remote.config -pa ./ebin/ -boot start_sasl -s shadowsocks_app start -noshell

Configuration
-----------
* Config files

 local.config, remote.config
* Descriptions

    {shadowsocks,
    [
      {type, local},
      {local_port,1080},
      {server,"localhost"},
      {server_port,8388},
      {password,"barfoo!"},
      {method,default}
    ]}


`{type, local}` is for client, `{type, remote}` is for server side.

`{error_logger, {file, "log/shadowsocks_client.log"}}`, logs will be written 
in `log/shadowsocks_client.log`, if you don't want it, use `{error_logger, silent}` instead

TODOs
-----------
* Check IPv6
* Compatible with RC4 method
